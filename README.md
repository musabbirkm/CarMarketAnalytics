## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to model car prices using regression techniques. The key steps include:

1. **Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Perform necessary preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Model Implementation**:
   - Implement and evaluate five regression models:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree Regressor
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor
     - Support Vector Regressor

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Compare models using R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
   - Identify the best-performing model.

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Identify significant variables affecting car prices.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about various car models, including features such as:

- **Symboling**: Insurance risk rating.
- **Fuel Type**: Type of fuel used (e.g., gas, diesel).
- **Aspiration**: Aspiration type (e.g., std, turbo).
- **Body Style**: Body style of the car (e.g., sedan, hatchback).
- **Drive Wheel**: Type of drive wheel (e.g., fwd, rwd).
- **Engine Location**: Location of the engine (e.g., front, rear).
- **Wheelbase**: Wheelbase of the car.
- **Curb Weight**: Weight of the car without occupants or baggage.
- **Engine Type**: Type of engine (e.g., dohc, ohc).
- **Horsepower**: Horsepower of the car.
- **Price**: Price of the car (target variable).

# Methodology

## Preprocessing
### Handling Missing Values:
- The dataset has no missing values, so no imputation is required.

### Encoding Categorical Variables:
- Categorical variables are converted into dummy variables using one-hot encoding.

### Feature Scaling:
- Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

## Regression Algorithms
### Linear Regression:
- Models a linear relationship between features and target.
- Suitable as a baseline model.

### Decision Tree Regressor:
- Splits data into subsets based on feature thresholds.
- Captures non-linear relationships but is prone to overfitting.

### Random Forest Regressor:
- Ensemble of decision trees to reduce overfitting.
- Handles non-linear relationships and feature interactions effectively.

### Gradient Boosting Regressor:
- Sequentially builds trees to correct errors from previous trees.
- Achieves high accuracy by focusing on hard-to-predict instances.

### Support Vector Regressor (SVR):
- Uses a kernel trick to model non-linear relationships.
- Suitable for small to medium-sized datasets but requires careful tuning.

## Evaluation Metrics
### Mean Squared Error (MSE):
- Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- Lower values indicate better performance.

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
- Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- Less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.

### R-squared (R²):
- Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.
- Higher values indicate better performance.

## Results
### Model Comparison
| Model                   | MSE   | MAE   | R²    |
|-------------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Linear Regression       | 0.5552 | 0.5332 | 0.6016 |
| Decision Tree           | 0.4836 | 0.4656 | 0.6532 |
| Random Forest          | 0.3254 | 0.3507 | 0.7666 |
| Gradient Boosting      | 0.2950 | 0.3339 | 0.7887 |
| Support Vector Regressor | 0.6285 | 0.5469 | 0.5503 |

### Best Model
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor** achieved the highest R² (0.7887) and lowest MSE (0.2950).

### Worst Model
- **Support Vector Regressor** had the lowest R² (0.5503) and highest MSE (0.6285).

## Feature Importance
The top 10 important features for predicting car prices are:
1. Engine Size
2. Horsepower
3. Curb Weight
4. Wheelbase
5. Car Width
6. Car Length
7. Bore Ratio
8. City MPG
9. Highway MPG
10. Compression Ratio

## Hyperparameter Tuning
After tuning, the **Gradient Boosting Regressor** achieved:
- **R²**: 0.8050
- **MSE**: 0.2800
- **MAE**: 0.3200

## Conclusion
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor** performed the best due to its ability to model complex relationships and correct errors iteratively.
- **Support Vector Regressor** performed the worst, likely due to the dataset's size and the need for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Feature importance analysis** revealed that engine size, horsepower, and curb weight are the most significant factors affecting car prices.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** improved the performance of the Gradient Boosting model.
